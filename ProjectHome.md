[Checkvist](http://checkvist.com) is an 'online collaborative outliner and task list manager'.

This is a simple implementation of the [checkvist.com API](http://checkvist.com/auth/api) in Python.

This code is at a very early stage and has not yet been thoroughly tested, but I'm putting it out there anyway. Feel free to [contact me](http://www.google.com/profiles/martinbrook) with any suggestions/bugs etc.

There is a [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/checkvist-api) for general discussion of the API.
